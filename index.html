            <!-- SYNOPSIS -->
            <h2 class="smallhead">Synopsis</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">The goal of this project is to make Blender viewport more informative concerning physics simulations. This project primarily focuses on the Rigid body simulation(similar to cloth simulation), which motivates to improve/develop displaying simulation data in other simulations in future. At present, in Blender, we can't detect the way the Rigid body behaves when it is in a complicated position. If we want to know it's behaviour, then we need to bake the data or need to test by playing the animation, which is slow while having more vertices or objects, but by displaying the simulation data of Rigid body in the viewport we can know it's behaviour without delay.</p>
            <!-- BENEFITS -->
            <h2 class="smallhead">Benefits</h2>
            
            <p class="paragraph">There are majorly three benefits concerning Time, Memory and GPU or CPU performance.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><a class="points">⁍</a>  Baking cache for the desired simulation without too many trails can save time, this can be achieved by simply displaying simulation data.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><a class="points">⁍</a>  If there is no simulation data displayed, then the user needs to play or bake the animation to get the desired simulation which results in more usage of RAM and HardDisk.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><a class="points">⁍</a>  Too many trails with the simulation will increase the number of CPU or GPU cycles per second, which affects the performance of the system. We can minimize this by displaying simulation data in the viewport.</p>


            <!-- DELIVERABLES -->
            <h2 class="smallhead">Deliverables</h2>
            <p class="paragraph"><a class="points">⁍</a> 
                A UI panel under Rigid body Physics Properties in the Properties Menu to control the visualization. </p>
             <p class="paragraph"><a class="points">⁍</a>  Different types of visualization data of Rigid body in the viewport, like Path of the Rigid body along with collision spots, Friction, Gravity, Normal Force, viscous Drag, Velocity/Angular Velocity and Torque/Force and Collision Margin.  </p>
            <p class="paragraph"><a class="points">⁍</a> If possible similar UI and visualization for the Cloth simulation in this GSOC project. If not, I will continue this even after the GSOC period for the cloth simulation.</p>
            <h3 class="littlehead">Documentation</h3>
            <p class="paragraph"><a class="points">⁍</a> 
                Documentation about all these features, describing briefly for the Users, will be documented to understand how they work(in simple words).</p>



            <!-- PROJECT DETAILS -->
            <h2 class="smallhead">Project Details</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">This project requires a basic understanding of Rigid body Dynamics to understand the behaviour of the Rigid body while the forces acting on it. Some of which plays a crucial role are Gravity, Friction and other external forces in the viewport.</p>
            <h3 class="littlehead">Path of the Rigid body and Collisions </h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Every Object inside Blender has its origin that is the centre of that object. Assuming this origin as the main object, it's travel path can be displayed in the viewport using the data of Rigid body and GLSL. Along with this, collision spots, where the body will collide with other Rigid body, can be highlighted along this path. </p>
            <h3 class="littlehead">Friction</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">If Rigid body is in contact with another Rigid body then there will be an opposing force that acts in the opposite direction of its motion, called Frictional Force. As friction is already an attribute to the Rigid body in blender, using that data of both the objects, a vector can be drawn showing Frictional Force(both Static and Kinetic) with the direction and its magnitude in the viewport.</p>
            <h3 class="littlehead">Gravitational Force</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Gravity is the main field of force that plays a key role in Rigid body Dynamics. This force is also an attribute in the Rigid body World properties under Field Weights. Using this data and mass of the Rigid body, Gravitational force can be calculated and displayed in the viewport along with the direction.</p>
            <h3 class="littlehead">Normal Force</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">If we know the g-value(gravitational constant) and the mass of the body then we can calculate the Normal Force. In some rare cases, if the object is inclined on the wedge-like thing then need to calculate the angle of inclination and need to apply some trigonometry laws to find both Normal and the gravitational force and their directions.</p>
            <h3 class="littlehead">Collision Margin</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">To collide two objects in Blender there is an important attribute, which decides the collision point between them, in Rigid body settings under sensitivity called Collision Margin. By using this data a virtual border can be visualized to make the user understand where the actual collision happens between them.</p>
            <h3 class="littlehead">Velocity and Angular Velocity</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The main vector property of any Rigid body, while it is in motion (translational or rotational), its velocity. Velocity can be visualized along with the direction in the viewport using the velocity data from the velocity attribute under the deactivation section in Rigid body settings, which calculates the Rigid body's velocity in the background.</p>
           
            <!-- PROJECT SCHEDULE -->
            <h2 class="smallhead">Project Schedule</h2>
            <h3 class="littlehead">May</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">As I already do have approximately six months of bonding with Blender-dev, I can utilize this time to research more on how to reduce the read and write time complexity of the code along with little bonding especially with mentors.</p>
            <h3 class="littlehead">June</h3>
            <p class="paragraph"><a class="points">⁍</a>  To write a C program to read and write PLY file or converting the existing library to C module for python.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><a class="points">⁍</a>  Begining to write a code to read and write STL in C.</p>
            <h3 class="littlehead">July</h3>
            <p class="paragraph"><a class="points">⁍</a>   If there is any pending work of June will be completed in July.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><a class="points">⁍</a>   Converting this STL read and write C program into module for python.</p>
            <h3 class="littlehead">August</h3>
            <p class="paragraph"><a class="points">⁍</a>   If there is any pending work of July will be done before the 8th/9th of this month.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><a class="points">⁍</a>   Finally importing C modules to python and testing once again(as testing will be done in each process).</p>




            <!-- BIOGRAPHY -->
            <h2 class="smallhead">Biography</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">I am Gali Ravi Praveen, a sophomore undergraduate student majoring in computer science and engineering from BML Munjal University, India. I was introduced to C when I was in my first year of engineering and then gradually I learned other languages as well like python, java, js, PHP etc. Currently as a vice-president of the Robotis club in the University, my knowledge of C programming has increased a lot.
            I did several projects in C and Python(<a class="links" href="https://github.com/grpnpraveen" target="_blank">github_link</a>). Apart from this, I am familiar with blender for 3 years and as a blender-dev for approximately 6 months.I also have some exposure to Blender Python API with which two addons were made for blender. One is a temporary solution for the grease pencil shadows issue(<a class="links" href="https://developer.blender.org/T85183" target="_blank">T85183</a>) and the other(<a class="links" href="https://developer.blender.org/T84348" target="_blank">T84348</a>) is an add-on that helps to attach texture maps to the object along with an extra feature that generates real-time displacement in Eevee similar to cycles. I made several tutorials and videos of blender on <a class="links" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvMXLm47z6agAc19Db-18Hg/videos" target="_blank">youtube</a> which helps others to understand modeling and animation. Using blender and unity I made some 2D games,one of which <a class="links" href="https://github.com/grpnpraveen/Stroop_Game" target="_blank">Stroop_play</a>.</p>
